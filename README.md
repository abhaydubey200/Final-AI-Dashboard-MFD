🚀 AI-Driven FMCG Decision Intelligence Platform

Enterprise Analytics • Executive AI • Boardroom-Ready

⸻

📌 Overview

This project is a production-grade, AI-assisted FMCG analytics platform developed during an internship at D’s Group.
It transforms raw FMCG operational data into executive-level insights, risks, and decision-ready intelligence using a secure, explainable, and API-free architecture.

The platform is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and designed to support:
	•	Leadership reviews
	•	Sales & operations monitoring
	•	Data-driven strategic decisions

⸻

🎯 Key Objectives
	•	Provide single source of truth for FMCG analytics
	•	Enable executive-friendly insights without technical complexity
	•	Deliver enterprise-safe AI reasoning (no hallucinations, no external APIs)
	•	Support real-time analysis across sales, outlets, SKUs, teams, and operations

⸻

🧠 Core Capabilities

✅ Executive KPI dashboards
✅ Advanced sales & daily trend analysis
✅ Product, SKU & brand intelligence
✅ Outlet & territory performance analysis
✅ Field force productivity tracking
✅ Order operations & rejection analysis
✅ Forecasting (trend-based, explainable)
✅ Data quality & integrity monitoring
✅ Snowflake SQL Studio (read-only, secure)
✅ AI Executive Chat (rule-based, deterministic)

🧾 Supported Dataset (MFD)

The platform supports FMCG datasets with columns such as:
	•	Orders & Transactions
	•	Sales & Discounts
	•	SKUs, Brands, Categories
	•	Outlets & Geography
	•	Sales Force & Warehouses
	•	Time, Productivity & Assets

Designed specifically for large-scale FMCG operational data.

🤖 AI Executive Assistant (Key Highlight)

What it is:
A ChatGPT-style executive intelligence interface.

What it does:
	•	Answers business questions using only dataset logic
	•	Supports drill-downs & explain-why follow-ups
	•	No predictions, no hallucinations, no APIs

Example Queries:
	•	“Total sales in June”
	•	“Why were orders rejected?”
	•	“Top 10 SKUs by revenue”
	•	“Which outlets are inactive?”

✔ Fully deterministic
✔ Leadership-safe

⸻

🔐 Security & Governance
	•	No external APIs or LLM calls
	•	No data leaves the platform
	•	Snowflake access is read-only
	•	Session-based data isolation
	•	Fully auditable Python & SQL logic

⸻

⚠️ Known Limitations
	•	Forecasting is trend-based (no ML models)
	•	Chat assistant is dataset-bounded
	•	Real-time streaming not enabled
	•	Role-based access control (RBAC) not yet implemented

All limitations are intentional design choices to ensure accuracy, safety, and executive trust.
